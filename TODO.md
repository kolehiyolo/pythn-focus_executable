- Create a list of dictionaries, each dictionary representing a mode, use placeholder values for now
- Populate the values for one with the bare-minimum expected values to see if the program works at its most simplest
- Reconfigure the skeleton of the script to run the expected flow
- Write the description
- Write the config_instructions
- Write the check_config
- Write the go_focus
- Repeat for the rest of the modes

- FOR NOW, I think forgoing the config_instructions and check_config parts is imperative, as otherwise I'd be stuck demotivated in writing instead of coding, so having placeholders is okay for the time being
